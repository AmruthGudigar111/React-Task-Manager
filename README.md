# 📝 React Task Manager

A modern and lightweight task management web app built using **React** and styled with **Bootstrap 5**.
The app lets users create, track, and manage daily tasks. It features a **light/dark mode toggle**, supports task completion toggling and deletion, and saves everything locally in the browser.

This project is personalized with a **custom logo and background image**, and proudly signed by **Amruth Gudigar**.
It’s perfect for learning React concepts like component structure, state management, props, conditional rendering, and local storage — all wrapped in a clean and branded UI.
